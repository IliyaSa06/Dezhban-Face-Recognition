‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Dezhban-Face-Attendance.git
cd Dezhban-Face-Attendance

2. Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python face-recognition mysql-connector-python pillow


‚ö†Ô∏è Note: face_recognition requires dlib
.
On Windows, it is recommended to install it using pre-built wheel packages.

3. Create the database

Run the following SQL commands in MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE face_attendance;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    face_encoding LONGTEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE attendance (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

4. Configure database connection

Update the db_config section in the main Python file:

db_config = {
    'host': '127.0.0.1',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'YOUR_PASSWORD',
    'database': 'face_attendance'
}

5. Run the program
python main.py

üì∑ How it works

Register New Employee ‚Üí Add a new employee using the camera or by uploading an image file.
